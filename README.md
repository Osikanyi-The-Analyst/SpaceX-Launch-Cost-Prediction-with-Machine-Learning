# Predicting SpaceX Launch Cost with Machine Learning 🚀💰🔮

This project is a data science capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course 💻🧠. The goal of this project is to predict the cost of SpaceX launches using publicly available data 💰📊. The project uses machine learning algorithms to build a model that can predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket, which significantly affects the cost of the launch 🤖🧠.

The project involves collecting data from SpaceX's website and other sources 💻🔎, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)🔍📈, and creating interactive visualizations to understand the data 📊📉. The machine learning model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python  🐍 and is trained on the data to make predictions 🔮. The results of the project are presented in a Plotly Dash dashboard that can be used to understand the cost of SpaceX launches and to compare the results with other launch providers💡📈.

This project showcases my skills in 💻📊, data wrangling 🔍🧼, EDA 🔍📈, machine learning 🤖🧠, and interactive visualizations📊📉. I am proud of the work I have done 💪  and I am eager to share it with colleagues, potential employers, and the IT world🌎💻. I am always seeking collaboration and feedback 🤝💬, so feel free to reach out to me with any questions or suggestions💬💭.
