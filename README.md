# Predicting SpaceX Launch Cost with Machine Learning 🚀💰🔮

This project is a data science capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course 💻🧠. The goal of this project is to predict the cost of SpaceX launches using publicly available data 💰📊. The project uses machine learning algorithms to build a model that can predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rocket, which significantly affects the cost of the launch 🤖🧠.

##💡 The Problem

SpaceX launches are an important part of the global space industry, but their cost can be quite unpredictable 💸. This can make it difficult for businesses, governments, and other organizations to budget for launches and to compare prices with other launch providers. With the goal of improving cost transparency, this project aims to predict the cost of SpaceX launches using machine learning algorithms 💰🔮.

##📊 Data Collection

The data used in this project is collected from SpaceX's website and other sources 💻🔎. It includes information about the type of mission, the rocket used, and whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket was reused or not. The data was then cleaned, wrangled, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis 🧼🔍

##🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To better understand the data and identify patterns, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed 🔍📈. The EDA process involved visualizing the data using various plots and charts to understand the distribution of the data and to identify correlations between different variables.

##📊 Interactive Visualizations

The results of the project are presented in a Plotly Dash dashboard that can be used to understand the cost of SpaceX launches and to compare the results with other launch providers 📊💡. The dashboard allows users to explore the data and to make their own predictions based on the information they provide 💻🔮.

##🤖 Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model was built using the scikit-learn library in Python 🐍. The model uses a decision tree algorithm to make predictions based on the data 🤖🔮. The results of the model were then evaluated using various metrics to determine its accuracy and performance.

## Tools and Technologies Used💻🧠
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Numpy 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🎨
- Plotly 📊
- Folium 🌎
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- SQL 🗄️

##Conclusion 💡

This project was a great opportunity to showcase my skills in data science and machine learning. I am proud of the work I have done and I am eager to share it with others. The project showed that machine learning can be used to make accurate predictions about the cost of SpaceX launches. The results of the project can be used by SpaceX and other launch providers to make informed decisions about the cost of their launches.

##Future Work 🔮

In the future, I would like to extend this project by adding more data and improving the accuracy of the model. I would also like to add more interactive visualizations to make the results even easier to understand. I am always open to collaboration and feedback, so feel free to reach out to me with any questions or suggestions 🤝💬
